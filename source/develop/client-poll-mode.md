---------------
If you didn't read the [intro](/develop/client.html) on Moza誰k extension clients, then you should consider [reading it first](/develop/client.html).

When you register your extension's client to Moza誰k, you have the ability to pass a **mode** which determine how the data will be pulled from your external service to Moza誰k.

`poll` mode is the default mode set when you register a client to Moza誰k.

## When using `poll` mode

It's useful when you want your client to fetch data from an external service at a given interval.

See [this page](/develop/client.html) for usage.
