This one is from [iamfiscus](https://github.com/iamfiscus), it comes with 2 widgets at the time I'm writing, 
one to show the current SauceLabs status from [status.saucelabs.com](http://status.saucelabs.com/) and another one showing a list of your jobs with extra info.

Have a look at the [repo's README](https://github.com/iamfiscus/mozaik-ext-saucelabs/blob/master/README.md) for instructions/details.

Thanks [@iamfiscus](https://github.com/iamfiscus)!
