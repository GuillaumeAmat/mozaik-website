If you didn't read the [intro]({{< relref "v1/hack/client.md" >}}) on Mozaïk extension client,
then you should consider [reading it first]({{< relref "v1/hack/client.md" >}}).

When you register your extension's client to Mozaïk, you have the ability to pass a **mode**
which determine how the data will be pulled from your external service to Mozaïk.

`push` must be specified when you register a client to Mozaïk.

## When using `push` mode

It's useful when you communicate with an external service through websockets or if you want
to connect Mozaïk to some sort of message queue.

The main difference with `poll` mode is that Mozaïk is no more responsible for fetching the data
at a given interval, your client acts as a producer and notify Mozaïk when it wants to push
some fresh data to its bound widgets.
