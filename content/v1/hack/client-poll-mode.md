If you didn't read the [intro]({{< relref "v1/hack/client.md" >}}) on Moza誰k extension clients,
then you should consider [reading it first]({{< relref "v1/hack/client.md" >}}).

When you register your extension's client to Moza誰k, you have the ability to pass a **mode**
which determine how the data will be pulled from your external service to Moza誰k.

`poll` mode is the default mode set when you register a client to Moza誰k.

## When using `poll` mode

It's useful when you want your client to fetch data from an external service at a given interval.

See [this page]({{< relref "v1/hack/client.md" >}}) for usage.
