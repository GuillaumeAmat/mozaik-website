title: Moza誰k 1.3.0 Released

Moza誰k **1.3.0** was released, shipping a **critical feature**: support for `push` mode, it solves [an issue](https://github.com/plouc/mozaik/issues/34) which have been there for far too long.

Before, Moza誰k just provided a polling model, which worked nicely for most of the cases.

However, some users wanted to push data from **live streams**, for example another WebSocket or a Message queue, but prior to this version, you can not decide when to send data to Moza誰k, you can only provide some endpoints to be called at a given interval.

So, now you have the ability to **decide when to push data**, more details on this [here](/develop/client-push-mode.html).  

As usual, **release notes** are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/plouc/mozaik/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
